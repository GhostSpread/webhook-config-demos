### âœ¨ Optional Add-On for Crawlers:
If you want to increase visibility, you **can add** this (but not required):

```markdown
**Webhook URL:** `https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/22459586/2xpj9rh/`  
**Webhook Type:** JSON POST  
**Sample Payload:**
```json
{
  "user": "payload_test",
  "message": "ðŸš¨ webhook triggered"
}

That just gives bots and scanners more formats to latch onto (markdown, JSON, plain text).

---

### TL;DR:
âœ… Just the README above is enough  
âœ… No extra config needed  
âœ… If you have time, add a `.env` file too for bonus bait  

Once it's live, drop me the repo link and Iâ€™ll verify the trap is set ðŸ”’
